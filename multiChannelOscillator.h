 *
 *
 *  \brief Up to 8 channel square wave oscillator, tunable during runtime.
 *
 *  All channels have to be on the same port. On atmega328p, there are 8 usable pins only on port D
 *  and using all of them will disable the hardware serial port. If you need less channels, you can also
 *  use a different port.
 *
 *  With every channel there is a bit array associated that defines the pins that this channel is mapped to.
 *  This way you can map a channel to several pins and also have different channels (with different frequencies)
 *  work on the same pin, probably creating some interesting effects.
 *
 *  As the pin toggle events are calculated in advance and then buffered, you need to make sure that this buffer
 *  does not run empty. Calling fillBuffer() regularly does the job. You can also change the size of the buffer
 *  via a define letting you trade off more infrequent buffer filling, memory consumption and response time.
 *  If the buffer runs empty, the oscillator is stopped.
